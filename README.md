# Health-Failure-Classification

With 17.9 million deaths per year or 31% of all deaths worldwide, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the 
leading cause of mortality worldwide. This dataset comprises 13 variables that may be used to predict 
death from heart failure, which is a typical occurrence brought on by CVDs. By addressing behavioral risk 
factors including cigarette use, unhealthy eating and obesity, inactivity, and problematic alcohol use with 
population-wide measures, the majority of cardiovascular illnesses may be avoided.


The data is downloaded from the machine learning repository whose title is “ Heart Failure Clinical Records
Data Set” (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records).
